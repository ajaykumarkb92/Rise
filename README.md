CHALLENGE:
	As we know that during diaster, migrating people from affected area to safe area will play the crucial part, so our 	    	    approach will be focused on finding the paths which are least affected and suitable for the rescue vehicle to reach the 	    affected area.

IDEA:
	We will develop a software that initially find all the paths from affected area to safe area, then few rescue team will 	start exploring the paths based on this information software will automatically update the paths which are available
	for successive rescue vehicle, using this information  software will analyse how many vehicles can take the specific path 	  (based on the parameters like width). From this information  rescue team will go to affected area. This approach will 	minimize the time of rescue operation which will inturn decreases the impact of the disaster.
