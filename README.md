[proposed change]
CHALLENGE:
	As we know that during disaster, migrating people from affected area to safe area will play the crucial part, so our approach will be focused on finding the paths which <strike>are least affected and</strike>{I think it is hard to find the level of usability}[] suitable for the rescue vehicle to reach the affected area.

IDEA:
	We <strike>will develop a software</strike>{It may not be appropriate to use the word software}[are planning to simulate the situation using open source tools] that initially finds all the paths from affected area to safe area. [The paths and the vehicles will be shown in the map] Then <strike>few</strike>{why few?}[] rescue teams will start exploring the paths to get to the affected areas. [As a rescue team finds a path  which is not available to use, they pass this information in the network.] Based on this information, <strike>software will automatically</strike>{}[ we ] update the <strike>paths</strike>{}[map] which shows available paths.
	for successive rescue vehicle, using this information  software will analyse how many vehicles can take the specific path 	  (based on the parameters like width). From this information  rescue team will go to affected area. This approach will 	minimize the time of rescue operation which will inturn decreases the impact of the disaster.
