CHALLENGE:
	As we know that during diaster, migrating people from affected area 
	to safe area will play the crucial part, So our approach will be focused 
	on finding the paths which are least affected and suitable for the rescue
	vehicle to reach the affected area.

IDEA:
	we will develop a software that initially find all the paths from 
	affected area to safe area, then  few rescue team will start 
	exploring the paths based on the information from rescue team,
	software will automatically update the paths which are available
	for successive rescue vehicle, using this information  software will
 	analyse how many vehicles can take the specific path (based on the -
 	parameters like width). From this information  rescue team will go to 
	affected area. This approach will minimize the time and maximise the
	efficiency which in turn decreases the life lose percentage.
